    <h1>Workshop</h1>
    <h3> In the Democracy Project  Panel, Jonathon Keats, an artist and experimental philosopher introduced his Democracy Project and the workshops that cooperate with SJSU. In the Democracy Project, Jonathon explains his idea of replaces the President and Congress with electromechanical decision engines, and to automate the executive and legislative functions mandated by the U.S. Constitution. At the same time, Keats was showing the renderings of his speculative apparatus image to the audience. What made me interested is, in Keats' speculative apparatus image, he made a circuit diagram of the government's working system. It made the audience understand well about his idea.
In the workshop section, Keats introduces the two workshops he cooperates with SJSU to made. The first one is “The Future Democracies Laboratory,” which is basically about his Democracy Project. The second workshop is “Systems Thinking: How To Represent Political District, Voter, Legislation, & Relationships Between Them?’.” I am very honored to be part of this work, students were asked to toss coins in the experiment. After each coin toss, record the front or the back and repeat it 50 times. In the end, we know that coins have a short-term memory, and tossing coins is not a fair choice. In addition, students were asked to imagine themselves as one of the political legislators. In short, Jonathon Keats‘ The Democracy Project  Panel was really giving me some inspiration in thinking, and I enjoyed the meeting very much.
